  <h2>Why we exist</h2>
  <p>Ribat Intelligence emerged as a sovereign outpost in a silent war. Inspired by the ribat — a historical frontier of Moroccan defense — our think tank positions itself as an intellectual stronghold, a cell of counter-influence, and a rooted analytical force.</p>
  <p>We receive no foreign funding, follow no partisan agendas, and serve no imported ideology. We are Moroccan sentinels. Our only allegiance is to strategic lucidity in service of Morocco.</p>

  <h2>Why now?</h2>
  <p>Because one fake news too many tipped the scale. One that led Moroccan crowds, unknowingly, to target a jewel of national economic sovereignty: <strong>Tanger Med</strong>.</p>
  <p>This manipulation, orchestrated and relayed by foreign influence networks, took root in an informational void. In the face of an inert press and silent institutions, Ribat Intelligence steps in — to name the unnamed, map the implicit, and awaken the unaware.</p>
