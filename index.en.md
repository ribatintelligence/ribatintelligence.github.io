  <h2>Why this project?</h2>
  <p>There was one fake news too many.</p>
  <p>One that drove thousands of Moroccans to the streets, unknowingly manipulated by an external narrative, targeting one of the pillars of our economic sovereignty: <strong>Tanger Med</strong>.</p>
  <p>A carefully orchestrated disinformation campaign, amplified by a foreign media outlet—always ready to exploit collective emotion in the service of regional interests.</p>
  <p>It is in this climate of organized disinformation and a dormant national press that <strong>Ribat Intelligence</strong> was born.</p>
  <p class="quote">A sovereign outpost. An intellectual stronghold. A Moroccan counter-influence cell.</p>
  <p>With no foreign funding. No partisan alignment. No imported ideology.</p>
  <p><strong>We stand with one camp only: a lucid, sovereign, unshaken Morocco.</strong></p>
