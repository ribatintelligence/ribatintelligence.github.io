  <h2>About Ribat Intelligence</h2>
  <p><strong>Ribat Intelligence</strong> is an independent Moroccan think tank born from urgency: the need to give Moroccans the tools to analyze, understand, and resist hostile narratives.</p>
  <p>In a context where traditional media struggles to name threats, and influence networks grow silently, we offer a lucid, rooted, and sovereign response.</p>

  <h2>Our approach</h2>
  <p>We combine strategic monitoring, counter-influence, narrative analysis, and public interest investigations. Our content blends factual rigor, pedagogical clarity, and attention to Moroccan realities.</p>

  <h2>Our independence</h2>
  <p>Ribat Intelligence is not funded by any foreign power, political party, or NGO. Our only compass is the higher interest of the Kingdom of Morocco.</p>
